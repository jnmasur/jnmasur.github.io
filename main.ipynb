    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This webpage \\([https://jnmasur.github.io](https://jnmasur.github.io)\\) was created by Jacob Masur and Daniel Cohen to investigate the distribution of internet access in Orleans Parish across geographic regions. We would like to answer the question: how accessible is wifi in different areas in Orleans Parish? Additionally, we want to find correlations between wifi access and demographic information such as income level, educational attainment, and ethnicity. It will also be interesting to investigate whether locations that provide access to free internet \\(for example, public libraries\\) are distributed in such a way that free internet access is optimized for those without access in their households. We predict that income level will have a significant impact on access to internet. In general, people with higher level of eduction also make more money and income is inequally distributed amongst different races, there will likely be a dependence on educational attainment and race.\n",

    "## Collaboration Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "We plan on meeting at least weekly to ensure that we collaborate enough on this project. We have set up a Jupyter notebook for which changes are being tracked and updated regularly in a public Github repository located at [https://github.com/jnmasur/jnmasur.github.io](https://github.com/jnmasur/jnmasur.github.io). The raw data, contained in a CSV file, and the text file that provides a full explanation of the data set is located in a subdirectory on our GitHub page. In general, we will be meeting in person to work on the project together. However, if the need arises, we will temporarily switch to Zoom meetings. Regardless of meeting schedule, we discuss what work needs to be accomplished, what is working well, and what we might need to rethink every few days to ensure that we are maintaining consistent progress.\n",

    "## Data Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "For our investigation, we will be using five distinct data sets. The first one contains census tract level information reagrding the type and precense of internet and computers by household for census tracts across the entire country and is provided by [NHGIS](https://www.nhgis.org/). We also obtained 3 other data sets from NHGIS, one providing the racial makeup by census tract, one detailing educational attainment for people 25 years of age or older by census tract, and one containing the median household income also by census tract. This data is the result of the [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-5year.html) which is conducted by the Census Bureau and is therefore a highly accurate survey from a trustworthy source. All datasets sourced from NHGIS contain country-wide data, and most contain many variables that are irrelevant to our discussion, so cleaning these sets is essential. The final data set contains geographic information for locations with free publicly accessible internet in Orleans Parish. This data comes from the [official New Orleans Database](https://data.nola.gov/) which is also a very trustworthy source. All data sets come from official government sources, so we believe that this data is accurate and will provide a good representation of internet access by race, income, and educational attainment."

We would also like to create a geographic map indicating the proportion of each census tract with access to internet and overlay this data with the locations of publicly accessible internet. If possible, we would like to calculate the distance from each census tract (more specifically, the center of the tract) to its closest publicly accessible internet location. This would allow us to test for correlation between that distance and the proportion of the tract that has access to internet which would inform us as to whether these locations are distributed appropriately."
